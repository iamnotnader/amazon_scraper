First, clone and cd into the ember app:
git clone https://bitbucket.org/iamnotnader/amazon-repricer-frontend
cd amazon-repricer-frontend

Install the things you need (ember-tools, coffeescript, and  compass):
npm install ember-tools
npm install coffee-script
sudo gem install compass

Now run the build tasks to watch your coffeescript, js, and sass files:
./node_modules/coffee-script/bin/coffee --compile --watch --output js/ coffee/
compass watch
./node_modules/ember-tools/bin/ember build --watch

Running the site locally
To do this, just open index.html in the amazon-repricer-frontend directory

The development loop
coffeescript files are stored in the coffee/ directory and compile into the js/ directory when you run the coffee command above
Ember takes the js/ that got compiled and builds it into a single application.js that’s referenced by index.html
When you modify coffee files while the three build commands above are running, your index.html should just update automatically
IMPORTANT: template files are stored in js/templates instead of coffee/templates. This is because coffeescript only moves coffee files into the js directory

Deploying to Heroku
It’s been running on my account but use the Heroku guide to deploy it to a different server. Should just be a matter of running:
heroku login ← enter YOUR credentials
heroku create ← maybe change the name if you want
git push heroku master ← you’re done!
