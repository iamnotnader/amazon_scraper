A web app that facilitates search engine optimization on Amazon

NOTE: This is not clean code...

Allows you to type multiple keyword phrases, then searches them all
individually on Amazon and joins the results. Very useful for determining
what keywords to include when listing products. Originally used to
list batteries.

Frontend is written with Ember using Ember-CLI
Backend is written using Flask and MongoDB
